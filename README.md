Future project of mine.

A Markdown Extra to HTML converter written in C for maximum (modern) portability. I may possibly allow it to convert to other languages besides HTML by means of an API available to programmers, but by default the path will lead to HTML.

## License

Look for `LICENSE.md` in the parent directory. You'll also be allowed to statically link this library as long as no modifications are made. So a little more liberal than LGPL. On a case-by-case basis, I may also allow direct compilation, but we'll see.
